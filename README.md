The images are the output of my programs and the insertion code that I made separately. I thought we were supposed to use our linked lists form last time so I started a separate file for that and included it as well.

The code substatiates a Queue of numbers 0 - 9 called elements, displays the unsorted queue using only push and pop functions found in the display function.
Then the first element is moved tyo the back and then displayed again. Then it shows the sorted queue using the later required recode for queues.
I couldn't get the queue to work in time. I included what I have on that as well in case partial credit is a thing.

Then the program creates a vector of ints called items with repearted numbers. I made a printing function to show the vector and then check for the last occurence 
of int 3.

As mentioned, I was able to make a sorter using my linked list that I included output images as well. It does work.

Thank you.
