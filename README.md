These are the outputs of my program.

The code substatiates a Queue of numbers 0 - 9 called elements, displays the unsorted queue using only push and pop functions found in the display function.
Then the first element is moved tyo the back and then displayed again. Then it shows the sorted queue using the later required recode for queues.
I originally thought we had to use the linked list class we made last time so I included (commented out) what I have on that as well in case partial credit is a thing.

Then the program creates a vector of ints called items with repearted numbers. I made a printing function to show the vector and then check for the last occurence 
of int 3.

As mentioned, Q3 was demonstrated at the beginning with queue work.

Thank you.
